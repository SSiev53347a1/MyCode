# MyCode
This Project has been created for Learning to track my code.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you copy of the project up and runnin on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites 

What things you need to install the software and how to install them. For now, maybe copy in how to install python and python3 using apt.

Selinium
Pycharm
Python3

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running. Eventually, maybe we could list Python packages requirements here. You can remove this section for now, or make a note to yourself to fill it out later.

Give example

and repeat other install steps....

until finished

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it in a demo

## Running the tests 

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system. We don't have any, so just make a note that there are none at this time.

## Deployment

Here we might put additional notes about how to deploy this on various systems. For now, just put a note that we are testing our code on Linux Ubuntu 16.84 LTS.

## Built With

* [Python] (https://python.org/) - The coding language used

## Contributing 

Here you could make notes about how others might contribute to your code. For right now, a friendly message saying you will accept any and all help from other coders would be great!
